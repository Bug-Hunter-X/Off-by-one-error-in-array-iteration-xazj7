# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when working with arrays in Java to prevent runtime exceptions.
